# <A PreWork Study Guide>

## Description

I saw a need for a study guide during my time in the UNH coding bootcamp. My motivation was to create an easy to access study guide, while I'm in the bootcamp I might need something to look back on, or to add to as I'm learning new ways of coding. Or to simply keep track of what I have learned on the way of completing this bootcamp.
